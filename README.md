### Human-in-the-loop image-based Automated Meter Reading System

We are developing a comprehensive, cloud-based automation system designed for non-smart meters, utilizing deep learning-based image recognition techniques and combining it with a human-in-the-loop verification framework based on crowd-sourcing and continuous retraining. We hope to create a robust and accurate solution for automated meter reading from customer-uploaded images of utility meters. Our vision is to supplant the currently expensive, labor-intensive, and error-prone process of manual operator-based reporting with self-reporting of meter readings for utility management companies. By doing this, we can enhance the efficiency of utility management. This also offers a viable solution for developing nations to maximize the use of their existing non-smart utility meters infrastructure.
